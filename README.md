# chinaByTheSea
I'm currently reimagining the website for my uncle's restaurant in Boothbay Harbor, ME. It's not live yet but hope to collaborate a transition soon!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Optimizations
Grabbed a template and edited the content. Also made minor adjustments to suit my needs to make the site fully functional and working smoothly.

## Lessons Learned:

Templates work well but aren't perfect all the time. As time passes, new adjustments must be made to adapt to the changing environment we work in.

## Projects:
Take a look at these projects that I have in my own portfolio:
